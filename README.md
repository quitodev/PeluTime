PeluTime is an application that makes it easy to reserve in hairdressers.

Using PeluTime you will be able to make reservations in hairdressers, barbershops and beauty centers attached to the application.

## How does the app work?
Once you have an account created, you can select the place you prefer and then choose the available hours of each professional.

With PeluTime it is no longer necessary to call to the place, just simply make your reservation and once the reservation was confirmed by the place, you will receive a push notification to let you know that the appointment has been reserved.

Even if the place does not confirm your reservation, you will also receive a push notification on your smartphone.
